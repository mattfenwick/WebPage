<h2>Recipes for working with branches in `git`</h2>

<p>If you've ever used `git`, and had to create and manage branches,
you know how frustrating it can be to remember all the magical incantations
(at least, that's how I always feel).  
That's why I've created a list of recipes for basic branching and merging
operations.  Enjoy!
</p>

<p>These recipes were distilled by me based on information found in 
<a href="http://progit.org/book/ch3-5.html">an awesome book by Scott Chacon</a>.

<pre>
# create a branch
git branch newbranch

# switch to an existing branch
git checkout newbranch

# push branch to github
git push origin newbranch

# pull branch on github to another computer
git fetch origin

# work on branch pulled from github
git checkout -b newbranch origin/newbranch

# merge new branch into master
#   first switch to master
git checkout master
git merge newbranch

# check that the merge worked
#   shows an "unmerged" section if any files failed
git status

# delete a branch (after merging it)
git branch -d newbranch

# see last commit on each branch
git branch -v

# see merged branches (to current branch)
git branch --merged

# see unmerged branches (to current branch)
git branch --no-merged

# delete remote branch
#   the syntax is widely acknowledge to be obtuse
git push origin :newbranch
