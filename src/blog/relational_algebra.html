<h1>Relational division</h1>


<p><h2>Intuitive meaning</h2>
Relational division is one of the core operators in relational algebra.
Using it, one can answer questions such as  
"What are all of the <x> that have/did/associate with <y>?"
</p>


<p><h2>Examples</h2>
Example 1:  what are all the combinations of (n1, n2) that have values of (1, 1) and (1, 2) for (n3, n4)?
<pre class="code">
+----+----+----+----+
| n1 | n2 | n3 | n4 |
+----+----+----+----+
|  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
|  1 |  1 |  1 |  2 |
|  1 |  1 |  1 |  3 |
|  1 |  1 |  1 |  4 |
|  1 |  1 |  2 |  1 |     +----+----+     +----+----+
|  1 |  1 |  2 |  2 |     | n3 | n4 |     | n1 | n2 |
|  1 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  %  +----+----+  =  +----+----+
|  1 |  2 |  1 |  1 |     |  1 |  1 |     |  1 |  1 |
|  1 |  2 |  1 |  2 |     |  1 |  2 |     |  1 |  2 |
|  1 |  2 |  2 |  3 |     +----+----+     +----+----+
|  1 |  2 |  2 |  4 |
|  1 |  3 |  1 |  3 |
|  1 |  3 |  1 |  4 |
|  2 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
|  2 |  2 |  1 |  2 |
|  2 |  2 |  2 |  1 |
|  2 |  2 |  2 |  2 |
+----+----+----+----+
</pre>

Example 2: what are all the combinations of (n1, n2) that have values of (1, 1) for (n3, n4)?
<pre class="code">
+----+----+----+----+
| n1 | n2 | n3 | n4 |

|  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
|  1 |  1 |  1 |  2 |
|  1 |  1 |  1 |  3 |

|  1 |  1 |  2 |  2 |     | n3 | n4 |     | n1 | n2 |
|  1 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  %  +----+----+  =  +----+----+
|  1 |  2 |  1 |  1 |     |  1 |  1 |     |  1 |  1 |
|  1 |  2 |  1 |  2 |     +----+----+     |  1 |  2 |
|  1 |  2 |  2 |  3 |                     |  2 |  1 |
|  1 |  2 |  2 |  4 |                     +----+----+
|  1 |  3 |  1 |  3 |
|  1 |  3 |  1 |  4 |
|  2 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
|  2 |  2 |  1 |  2 |
|  2 |  2 |  2 |  1 |

<p><h2>The code: template</h2>
Here's a template for relational division.  Each numbered box must be filled according to the exact
tables used and columns desired in the result:
<pre class="code">
select <span class="box">1</span> from (
  select 
    <span class="box">2</span>.*  -- don't forget the ".*" !!
  from <span class="box">2</span>
  inner join <span class="box">3</span>
  <span class="box">4</span>
) as r
group by <span class="box">5</span>
having count(*) = (select count(*) from <span class="box">3</span>);
</pre>

Explanation of the numbered boxes:
<ol>
 <li>columns in outermost select:  set of dividend's columns that ARE NOT in the divisor.  Also known as "quotient" columns</li>
 <li>dividend table:  there should be no duplicates</li>
 <li>divisor table:  its set of columns must form a PROPER subset of dividend's columns*</li>
 <li>join condition:  all divisor columns must compare equal to their corresponding dividend columns</li>
 <li>group by columns:  same as 1</li>
</ol>

Note that the purpose of the "having" clause is to allow selection only of those groups
with number of rows equal to the number of rows in divisor.
</p>


<p><h2>How it works: (Example 2 from above)</h2>
<table border="2">
 <tr>
  <td>dividend</td>
  <td>divisor</td>
  <td>Step 1: join dividend to divisor on divisor's columns (n3, n4)</td>
  <td>Step 2: group join results by quotient columns</td>
  <td>Step 3: select groups that have the right "count", and project onto quotient columns</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>

<p><h2>The code: filled-in template</h2>
Using the tables shown in the examples above, and "dividend" and "divisor" as the names of the
dividend and divisor tables, respectively, we can fill in the template:
<pre class="code">
select <b>r.n1, r.n2</b> from (
  select 
    <b>dividend</b>.*
  from <b>dividend</b>
  inner join <b>divisor</b>
  <b>using (n3, n4)</b>
) as r 
group by <b>r.n1, r.n2</b>
having count(*) = (select count(*) from <b>divisor</b>);
</pre>
</p>


<p><h2>Other methods</h2>
There is another popular way to do relational division, involving a double-negative 
("... where not exists (where not in ...) ...").  Although others find it easier to understand,
I do not.

Also, one code use a code generator or stored procedure that parameterizes production
of a SQL string, automatically filling in the template.  I didn't use this approach because
that opens the door to a host of SQL injection-related problems.
