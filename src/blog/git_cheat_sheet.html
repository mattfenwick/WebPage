what happens with sha-1 business?


see remotes
git remote -v
-

get remote data -- get all the data that you don't yet have locally
git fetch <remote>
-

show info about a remote
git remote show <remote>
-

rename a remote (i.e. change the local alias -- doesn't change anything on the actual remote server)
git remote rename <old> <new>
also renames remote branch names

git rm <remote>

see all tags
git tag
-

see tags matching a pattern
git tag -l <pattern>
this doesn't seem to work



questions:

 - in .gitignore, if you have a pattern that says don't include, and another that contradicts it, who wins?

 - how many characters needed to identify an sha-1 key?  (seems to complain if ambiguous)
 
 - what is a tracking branch
