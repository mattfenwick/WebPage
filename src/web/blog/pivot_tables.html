<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>Pivot tables are a useful tool in data analysis, allowing a user to quickly and easily understand the relationship between two attributes.
However, they aren't straightforward to create in many database systems.  In this article, we'll look at:
<ol>
 <li>What is a pivot table?</li>  
 <li>Why would I need a pivot table?</li>
 <li>How do I create a pivot table?</li>
</ol>
To answer these questions, we'll create and use pivot tables with MySQL.
</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2>Background</h2>

<p><b>1. What is a pivot table?</b>  It's a summary table used for reporting, analysis, and quick data inspection purposes.  
The name comes from the fact that the columns in the pivot table were row values in the base table; these values are <b>pivoted</b> into columns headers.
<br />

Terminology used in this article: 
<ul>
 <li>base table: the table of interest that we'll analyze</li>
 <li>columns of interest: the two columns from the base table, whose relationship is shown through the pivot table</li>
 <li>y-values: values from the first column of interest.  The pivot table will have one row for each distinct y-value</li>
 <li>x-values: values from the second column of interest.  The pivot table will typically have one column for each distinct x-value</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>2. Why would I need a pivot table?</b> 
   Pivot tables provide summaries of data that are much easier to grok than the full table.  
   They typically focus on two columns, providing aggregate data which can help indicate the relationships between them.</p>

<p><b>3. How do I create a pivot table?</b> There is a straight-forward procedure for creating pivot tables: 
   (indicate no. of rows, columns after each step)
<ol>
 <li>select the two columns of interest.  
     Call them x and y:  the y-values become values in the first column, while the x-values become column headers.  
    The pivot table ends up with 1 y column, plus 1 column for each x-value</li>
 <li>create a view/query that adds extra columns to each row of the base table, indicating the type of the row</li>
 <li>aggregate the extended table using appropriate aggregate functions, grouping by the y-value column</li>
</ol>

<p><b>2. and 3. </b> will be covered in more detail in the remainder of this article.</p>

<h2>Example: pivoting investment data</h2>

<p>In this example, we'll look at data showing shares purchased during a number of investments made over three years 
(note: these are hypothetical companies -- if the names bear any resemblance to real companies' names, it is purely coincidental :).
We'll start with the table schema and some sample data:

<br />
<pre>
create table investment (
  id       int primary key auto_increment, 
  year     int, 
  person   varchar(50), 
  stock    varchar(50), 
  shares   int
);

mysql> select * from investment;
+----+------+---------+--------+--------+
| id | year | person  | stock  | shares |
+----+------+---------+--------+--------+
|  1 | 2009 | Matt    | Google |     27 |
|  2 | 2009 | Jeffrey | Google |     13 |
|  3 | 2010 | Timothy | Yahoo  |     31 |
|  4 | 2009 | Matt    | Yahoo  |      4 |
|  5 | 2011 | Timothy | IBM    |    100 |
|  6 | 2011 | Timothy | Google |     34 |
|  7 | 2010 | Jeffrey | Yahoo  |     68 |
|  8 | 2010 | Jeffrey | Yahoo  |     18 |
|  9 | 2011 | Matt    | IBM    |     49 |
| 10 | 2011 | Matt    | Google |     22 |
| 11 | 2011 | Timothy | Yahoo  |     51 |
| 12 | 2009 | Jeffrey | Yahoo  |     63 |
+----+------+---------+--------+--------+
</pre>

<br />
Requirements -- our final goal is queries showing:
<ol>
 <li>the number of shares of each company bought by each investor</li>
 <li>the number of times each investor has bought stock in each company</li>
</ol>
We'll do this by creating two separate, but related, pivot tables.
</p>

<br />
<p><h3>Step 1: choose columns of interest</h3>
According to the requirements, we need to see investor vs. stock.  Thus, those will be our two columns.  
I'll choose `person` as the y-value column, and `stock` as the x-value column.
<i>(For this example, the choice is arbitrary, but see the "Limitations" section for a reason to choose more carefully).</i></p>

<br />
<p><h3>Step 2: extend</h3>  Extend the base table with extra columns, one for each x-value of interest.
Put an appropriate value in each of the columns, or a neutral value if the column doesn't apply:
<br />
<pre>
create view investment_extended as (
  select
    investment.*, 
    case when stock = "Google"  then shares end as Google,
    case when stock = "IBM"     then shares end as IBM,
    case when stock = "Yahoo"   then shares end as Yahoo 
  from investment
);

mysql> select * from investment_extended;
+----+------+---------+--------+--------+--------+------+-------+
| id | year | person  | stock  | shares | Google | IBM  | Yahoo |
+----+------+---------+--------+--------+--------+------+-------+
|  1 | 2009 | Matt    | Google |     27 |     27 | NULL |  NULL |
|  2 | 2009 | Jeffrey | Google |     13 |     13 | NULL |  NULL |
|  3 | 2010 | Timothy | Yahoo  |     31 |   NULL | NULL |    31 |
|  4 | 2009 | Matt    | Yahoo  |      4 |   NULL | NULL |     4 |
|  5 | 2011 | Timothy | IBM    |    100 |   NULL |  100 |  NULL |
|  6 | 2011 | Timothy | Google |     34 |     34 | NULL |  NULL |
|  7 | 2010 | Jeffrey | Yahoo  |     68 |   NULL | NULL |    68 |
|  8 | 2010 | Jeffrey | Yahoo  |     18 |   NULL | NULL |    18 |
|  9 | 2011 | Matt    | IBM    |     49 |   NULL |   49 |  NULL |
| 10 | 2011 | Matt    | Google |     22 |     22 | NULL |  NULL |
| 11 | 2011 | Timothy | Yahoo  |     51 |   NULL | NULL |    51 |
| 12 | 2009 | Jeffrey | Yahoo  |     63 |   NULL | NULL |    63 |
+----+------+---------+--------+--------+--------+------+-------+
</pre>

Note that: 
<ol>
 <li>I'm using NULL as the neutral value</li>
 <li>whether a new column has a non-null value depends on its x-value:  
     rows with `stock = "Google"` have a value for new column `Google` and `NULL`s for the other new columns</li>
 <li>this distinction "marks" each row with its type -- and is the key to getting Step 3 to work</li>
 <li>whenever a new column is non-null:  its value is always equal to column `shares` -- so we can meet the requirements</li>
 <li>we didn't change the number of rows</li>
 <li>we added one column per x-value of interest</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br />

<p><h3>Step 3: group by y-values and apply aggregate function</h3>
Our first requirement was to total shares bought per investor at each company.
To accomplish that, we start with the view from Step 2, 
and remember that column `person` provides the y-values, so we'll need to `group by person`; 
also, we need the `sum` aggregate function to total the rows.

<br />
<br />
<pre>
create view pivot_company_shares as (
  select 
    person, 
    sum(Google)            as Google, 
    coalesce(sum(IBM), 0)  as IBM, 
    sum(Yahoo)             as Yahoo 
  from investment_extended 
  group by person
);

mysql> select * from pivot_company_shares;
+---------+--------+------+-------+
| person  | Google | IBM  | Yahoo |
+---------+--------+------+-------+
| Jeffrey |     13 |    0 |   149 |
| Matt    |     49 |   49 |     4 |
| Timothy |     34 |  100 |    82 |
+---------+--------+------+-------+
</pre>
Look at that -- how beautiful!
Note that in `pivot_company_shares`, we use `coalesce` to check the IBM column for null, returning 0 if it is and the column value otherwise.
This is because one of the investors didn't buy any IBM, and using `sum` on a bunch of null values returns null!
We could have just left it as null, but the 0 looks a lot nicer.

<br />
To meet the second requirement, which is how many times each investor bought each stock,
we just need to know how many rows from the extended view have non-null values.
An easy way to do that is with the aggregate function `count(n)` -- it returns the number of rows with a non-null value for column `n`.
<br />
<pre>
create view pivot_company_transactions as (
  select 
    person, 
    count(Google)  as Google, 
    count(IBM)     as IBM, 
    count(Yahoo)   as Yahoo 
  from investment_extended 
  group by person
);

mysql> select * from pivot_company_transactions;
+---------+--------+-----+-------+
| person  | Google | IBM | Yahoo |
+---------+--------+-----+-------+
| Jeffrey |      1 |   0 |     3 |
| Matt    |      2 |   1 |     1 |
| Timothy |      1 |   1 |     2 |
+---------+--------+-----+-------+
</pre>
<br />
And ... voila!  We didn't need to check for NULL this time because count returns 0 if it only find NULLs.
</p>


<br />
<p><h2>Important points</h2>
<ul>
 <li>what aggregate function to use when grouping.  
     I used sum, but count and max are also often used (max is often used when building one-row "objects" that had been spread across many rows)</li>
 <li>what value to use in the extra columns -- the requirements dictated `shares` in this case</li>
 <li>what "neutral" value to use in the extra columns. I used NULL, but it could also be 0 or ""</li>
 <li>using multiple columns for y-values. This solution isn't limited to using a single column for the y-values -- 
     just plug the extra columns into the group by clause (and don't forget to select them)</li>
</ul>


<br />
<h2>Conclusion and limitations</h2>

<p>Pivot tables are quite useful and relatively straightforward.  
   However, one downside to the approach I've outlined is that you have to know how many columns the pivot table will have <b>in advance</b>.
   The frustrations this causes can range from mildly annoying (adds extra typing) to severely limiting, if there are hundreds of values.

<p>The inspiration for this post came from reading the SQL Cookbook by Anthony Molinaro, chapter 12.
   I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their SQL chops, from beginner to advanced.
