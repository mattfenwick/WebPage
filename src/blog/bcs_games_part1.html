Are you a college football fan? &nbsp;Ever wondered whether the games are more exciting this year than last? &nbsp;Whether higher-ranked teams perform better than lower-ranked teams? &nbsp;Whether this year's games were the highest scoring?<br />
<br />


<h2>Background</h2>
<br />
Every year following the college football regular season since 1998, the Bowl Championship Series (or BCS) has held 5 (originally 4) bowl games between some of the top teams in the country. &nbsp;We're going to look at some of the numbers behind the games.<br />
<br />
In this post, we'll see the data schema and how it's analyzed. &nbsp;In the second part, we'll look at the data itself.<br />
<br />


<h2>The requirements</h2>
<br />
I wanted to analyze the statistics based on a few different criteria, including:<br />
<ol>
<li>team</li>
<li>conference</li>
<li>bowl</li>
<li>year</li>
<li>team rank</li>
<li>qualification</li>
<li>score</li>
</ol>
So I needed to have all these captured as attributes somehow.<br />
<br />


<h2>The schema</h2>
<br />
After a few rounds of normalization/head-banging/repeat, there were two main entities: &nbsp;bcsgame and bcsteam. &nbsp;A "bcsgame" occurred at a specific location on a specific date, between two "bcsteam"s, and ended with each "bcsteam" have a number of points. &nbsp;Also, each "bcsteam" was ranked (using the pre-bowl BCS poll) and associated with a specific conference at the start of the game.<br />
<br />
Here's what that looked like translated into MySQL code:<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">
create table if not exists `bcs_game` (
  `id`              int primary key auto_increment,
  `date`            date,
  `city`            varchar(45),
  `bowl`            varchar(45),
  `isChampionship`  boolean
);

create table if not exists `bcs_team` (
  `id`         int primary key auto_increment,
  `name`       varchar(45),
  `conf`       varchar(45),
  `points`     int,
  `rank`       int,
  `qual`       varchar(45),
  `id_game`    int,
    foreign key (`id_game` )
      references `football`.`bcs_game` (`id` )
);
</pre>
<br />
Well, that looks pretty straightforward: &nbsp;we have "bcs_game" with its attributes, and "bcs_team" with <i>its</i>&nbsp;attributes, and a foreign key to the game that the team participated in.<br />
<br />


<h2>Analyzing the schema: strengths and weaknesses</h2>
&nbsp;- strengths<br />
<ul>
<li>all teams, <b>winners and losers</b>, in one table. &nbsp;This makes it much easier to query than what I had originally tried: &nbsp;two foreign keys from "bcs_game" to "bcs_team"</li>
<li>winner/loser is determined by score only -- there's no need to store duplicate information with a winner/loser column.</li>
</ul>
<br />
&nbsp;- weaknesses<br />
<ul>
<li>problem with national championship game. &nbsp;After the 2006 season, the BCS expanded to 5 games each year by creating a special national championship game. &nbsp;Previously it had rotated between the four big bowls. &nbsp;This was awkward to deal with in the schema.</li>
<li>a programmer's (mine!) mistake could result in a game between three or more teams (or 0 or 1)! &nbsp;There's nothing enforcing the requirement that exactly two teams participate in a game.</li>
<li>"conference" and "bowl" could/should be entities in their own right.</li>
</ul>
<br />


<h2>Populating the database</h2>
All the data used for this project was taken from the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series">Wikipedia BCS page</a>.<br />
<br />
Analyzing the data<br />
<br />
An array of views were created to analyze the data. &nbsp;They were structured in three tiers. &nbsp;First, the "end-user" views, or those views returning result sets of interest to somebody perusing the data. &nbsp;In the middle, the second layer was the glue layer that tied the end-user views to the third layer, which was the "base" views which did the basic joins required by almost every end-user query.<br />
<br />
For example, here's a "base" view:<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">create view joined_teams as
  select
    l.name    as w_name,
    l.points  as w_points,
    l.rank    as w_rank,
    l.conf    as w_conf,
    l.qual    as w_qual,
    r.name    as l_name,
    r.points  as l_points,
    r.rank    as l_rank,
    r.conf    as l_conf,
    r.qual    as l_qual,
    l.id_game
  from
    bcs_team l
  inner join
    bcs_team r
   on
     l.id_game = r.id_game and l.points &gt; r.points; -- the winner is always on the left</pre>
<br />
What this does is join every pair of teams that played in the same game by equating "id_game". &nbsp;The rest of the join condition -- "l.points &gt; r.points" ensures that the winner is on the left and the loser is on the right! &nbsp;Also, it keeps us from seeing the same row twice.<br />
<br />
Here's a typical "glue-layer" view:<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">create view team_wins as
  select 
    w_name, 
    count(*) as wins 
  from 
    joined_teams 
  group by 
    w_name;</pre>
<br />
This view returns the name and the number of wins for each team that had at least one win.<br />
<br />
And here's an "end-user" view (the difference between this and the previous view is that this one combines lots of "glue-layer" views):
<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">create view conf_report as
  select 
    a.conf, 
    appearances, 
    coalesce(wins, 0)         as `wins`, 
    coalesce(losses, 0)       as `losses`,
    apoints                   as `points scored`,
    opoints                   as `points given up`,
    wpoints                   as `avg points, wins`,
    lpoints                   as `avg points, losses`,
    coalesce(rose, 0)         as `rose`,
    coalesce(orange, 0)       as `orange`,
    coalesce(fiesta, 0)       as `fiesta`,
    coalesce(sugar, 0)        as `sugar`,
    coalesce(championship, 0) as `championship`,
    teams   
  from 
    conf_appearances a 
  left join
    conf_wins b 
    on a.conf = b.w_conf 
  left join 
    conf_losses c 
    on a.conf = c.l_conf
  left join
    conf_rose e
    on a.conf = e.conf
  left join
    conf_orange f
    on a.conf = f.conf
  left join
    conf_fiesta g
    on a.conf = g.conf
  left join 
    conf_sugar h
    on a.conf = h.conf
  left join
    conf_champ i
    on a.conf = i.conf
  left join
    conf_teams j
    on a.conf = j.conf;
</pre>
<br />
Ugh! &nbsp;That's nasty! &nbsp;What's going on here with all these left joins?<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>we're combining columns from lots of views -- that's why we need so many joins</li>
<li>some views might not have values for some conferences -- using "left join" lets us keep that row, giving it a null</li>
<li>we use coalesce at the end to replace null's with 0's</li>
</ul>
