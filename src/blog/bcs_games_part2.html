In <a href="http://mfenwick100.blogspot.com/2012/01/creating-database-for-analyzing-college.html">part 1</a> of this piece, we saw:<br />
<ul>
<li>the ER model of the data</li>
<li>the MySQL implementation of the model</li>
<li>how the data was analyzed using a 3-layer view approach</li>
</ul>
In this second part, we're going to look at some of the data from the analysis, and answer these questions:<br />
<ol>
<li>which year were the games the most exciting?</li>
<li>which year were the games the least exciting?</li>
<li>did this past BCS season see any total scoring records set?</li>
<li>what was 2004's claim to fame?</li>

<br />
Now let's get to work on our quiz.<br />
<br />

<h3>Question 1:&nbsp; which year's games were the most exciting?</h3>
To answer this, we need the year where the margin of victory was smallest.<br />
<br />
So let's try:<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">select * 
from year_report 
order by `margin` asc&nbsp;</pre>
<pre class="code">limit 1;
</pre>
<br />
And let's see what that gives us:<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">+------+----------------+---------------+--------+--------------+
| year | points, winner | points, loser | margin | total points |
+------+----------------+---------------+--------+--------------+
| 2006 |        34.7500 |       29.0000 | 5.7500 |      63.7500 |
+------+----------------+---------------+--------+--------------+&nbsp;</pre>
<pre class="code">&nbsp;</pre>
It looks like 2006 was the best year to watch the BCS games -- on average, less than a touchdown separated the victors from the vanquished!<br />
<br />

<h3>Question 2: which year's games were the least exciting?</h3>
This is very similar to question, so we'll slightly modify our query to <br />
<br />
<pre class="code">select * 
from year_report 
order by `margin` desc&nbsp;   -- now it's "desc" instead of "asc"!</pre>
<pre class="code">limit 1;
</pre>
<br />
Which returns:<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">+------+----------------+---------------+---------+--------------+
| year | points, winner | points, loser | margin  | total points |
+------+----------------+---------------+---------+--------------+
| 2002 |        44.5000 |       21.7500 | 22.7500 |      66.2500 |
+------+----------------+---------------+---------+--------------+</pre>
<br />
Wow, look at that!&nbsp; In 2002, the winners had more than twice the points of the losers, <b>and were winning by more than three touchdowns!</b>&nbsp; Snore!<br />
<br />


<h3>Question 3: did this past BCS season see any total scoring records set?</h3>
&nbsp;Let's try:<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">select * from year_report order by `total points` desc</pre>
<br />
Which returns:<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">+------+----------------+---------------+---------+--------------+
| year | points, winner | points, loser | margin  | total points |
+------+----------------+---------------+---------+--------------+
| 2002 |        44.5000 |       21.7500 | 22.7500 |      66.2500 |
| 2012 |        40.0000 |       25.8000 | 14.2000 |      65.8000 |
| 2006 |        34.7500 |       29.0000 |  5.7500 |      63.7500 |
| 2008 |        40.0000 |       20.0000 | 20.0000 |      60.0000 |
| 2007 |        36.2000 |       20.2000 | 16.0000 |      56.4000 |
| 2000 |        32.2500 |       23.2500 |  9.0000 |      55.5000 |
| 2005 |        36.0000 |       19.0000 | 17.0000 |      55.0000 |
| 2011 |        32.4000 |       19.2000 | 13.2000 |      51.6000 |
| 2003 |        32.2500 |       17.0000 | 15.2500 |      49.2500 |
| 2010 |        31.0000 |       17.2000 | 13.8000 |      48.2000 |
| 1999 |        29.0000 |       17.7500 | 11.2500 |      46.7500 |
| 2001 |        31.2500 |       13.7500 | 17.5000 |      45.0000 |
| 2009 |        27.4000 |       16.6000 | 10.8000 |      44.0000 |
| 2004 |        25.0000 |       17.5000 |  7.5000 |      42.5000 |
+------+----------------+---------------+---------+--------------+
14 rows in set (0.05 sec)</pre>
<br />
Ooh what a bummer!&nbsp; We missed out on setting a new scoring record by 0.45 points per game!&nbsp; That's 0.225 points per team per game!&nbsp; In fact, if LSU had managed a single field goal against Alabama in the championship game, there would have been an average of 66.4 points per game, setting a new record!<br />
<br />


<h3>Question 4: what was 2004's claim to fame?</h3>
How about a little hint:&nbsp; you can see it in the answer to Question 3.&nbsp; Did you get it?<br />
<br />
Here it is:&nbsp; in 2004, the fewest points per game were scored.&nbsp; Not only that, but the <b>winning</b> teams scored a paltry, record-low 25 points per game; in fact, <b>the winners in 2004</b> scored fewer points per game <b>than the losers in 2012</b>.&nbsp; Makes you wonder whether defenses are getting worse or offenses better.<br />
<br />
In fact, let's find all the years where winners scored less than losers in another year: 
<br />
<br />
We'll use this query:
<br />
<br />
<pre class="code">select l.year as `winner year`, r.year as `loser year`, l.`points, winner`, r.`points, loser` 
from year_report l 
inner join year_report r 
  on l.`points, winner` < r.`points, loser`;</pre>
<br />
<br />Which results in:
<br />
<pre class="code">+-------------+------------+----------------+---------------+
| winner year | loser year | points, winner | points, loser |
+-------------+------------+----------------+---------------+
|        2004 |       2006 |        25.0000 |       29.0000 |
|        2009 |       2006 |        27.4000 |       29.0000 |
|        2004 |       2012 |        25.0000 |       25.8000 |
+-------------+------------+----------------+---------------+
3 rows in set (0.05 sec)</pre>
<br />
Wow!  There are three cases where winners have done worse than losers (in a different year, of course!)!
