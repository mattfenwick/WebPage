<h2>Partial application:  Haskell vs. Clojure</h2>

<p>
<h3>What is partial application?</h3>

According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">Wikipedia</a>, partial function application 

<blockquote>refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity.</blockquote>

In other words, if you have a function of, say, 3 arguments, and you only pass it 1 argument, you get a new function of 2 arguments.  For example:

<pre>
# f is a function of 3 arguments
f(x,y,z) = x + y + z

# g is now a function of 2 arguments
g = f(3)

# now let's evaluate g
x1 = g(11, 8)

# this is the same as:

x2 = f(3, 11, 8)

# and this too:

x3 = f(3, 11)(8)
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Example application:  calculating numeric derivatives</h3>
One definition of a derivative is:  <b>the limit of <pre>(f(x+h) - f(x)) / h</pre> as h approaches 0</b>.

We'll define "d" as a function that calculates the derivative of a function at a specific value of x. So it'll need 3 arguments: a function, a value for h, and a value for x. 
<p>

<p>
<h3>Haskell version</h3>
Here's our implementation of "d":

<pre>
d f h x = (v2 - v1) / h
  where
    v2 = f (x + h)
    v1 = f x
</pre>

That says that we're defining "d" as a function of 3 arguments, and using two bindings -- v1 and v2 -- to make the formula to read.  Here it is in action:
<pre>
> square x = x * x  

> d square 0.1 14          -- larger h: less precision
28.100000000000023

> d square 0.0001 14
28.000099999871964

> d square 0.000001 14     -- smaller h: more precision
28.000000980910045
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Unleashing the magic: Haskell</h3>
In Haskell, functions are always partially applied -- we don't have to do anything special to get this to happen.  So, for example:
<pre>
>square_h_and_x = d square    -- square_h_and_x is a function that needs two arguments:  h and x
>square_h_and_x 0.1 14
28.100000000000023            -- same result as "d square 0.1 14"

>square_x = d square 0.1      -- square_x is a function of 1 argument
>square_x 14
28.100000000000023            -- again, same result

>square_x_2 = square_h_and_x 0.1
>square_x_2 14
28.100000000000023            -- once again, same result
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Clojure version</h3>
Here's d:
<pre>
(defn d 
  [f x h] 
  (let [v2 (f (+ x h))   
        v1 (f x)] 
   (/ (- v2 v1) h))) 
</pre>

And some examples:

<pre>
user=> (defn square [x] (* x x))
#'user/square

user=> (d square 0.1 14)                   
28.100000000000023

user=> (d square 0.0001 14)
28.000099999871964

user=> (d square 0.000001 14)
28.000000980910045
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Unleashing the magic:  Clojure</h3>
In Clojure, functions are <b>not</b> partially applied, unless you explicitly ask for it with the "partial" function:
<pre>
;; define a function of 2 arguments
user=> (defn add [x y] (+ x y))
#'user/add                

;; passing just 1 argument causes an exception
user=> (add 3)
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong number of args (1) passed to: user$add (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)

;; using partial and passing a single argument returns a new function ...
user=> (partial add 3)
#<core$partial$fn__3682 clojure.core$partial$fn__3682@6f3f903b>

;; ... of one argument
user=> ((partial add 3) 4)
7

;; which works as expected
user=> (add 3 4)
7
</pre>

So here's what our examples look like:

<pre>
user=> (def square_h_and_x (partial d square))
#'user/square_h_and_x
user=> (square_h_and_x 0.1 14)
28.100000000000023

user=> (def square_x (partial d square 0.1))
#'user/square_x
user=> (square_x 14)
28.100000000000023

user=> (def square_x_2 (partial square_h_and_x 0.1))
#'user/square_x_2
user=> (square_x_2 14)
28.100000000000023
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
We learned how to use partial application in Clojure and Haskell.  Although Haskell has better syntactic support for it, it was easy to partially apply functions in both languages.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Who cares?</h3>
Why would anyone ever use this?  

How about:
<ul>
<li>default arguments.  Values for parameters that often don't need to be explicitly set can be easily set using a partially applied function.</li>
<li>function specialization, without losing flexibility.  You wish to expose a simple interface to client code, without losing any flexibility.  Perhaps you have a function of 5 arguments, but the interface requires a 2 argument function.  You can easily build the latter from the former using partial application.  Meanwhile, the original function is still available for testing and further development.</li>
<li>families of related functions.  Think of "sort", which would take a list of comparable elements, compared to "sortWith", which would take a comparator and a list of comparable elements.  "sort" can easily be built out of "sortWith", saving the trouble and inherent problems of implementing the sorting algorithm twice.</li>
</ul>
