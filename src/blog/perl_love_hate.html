Perl5 is a great programming language, with a great community, great philosophy, and many, many impressive technical achievements.

But in some ways, perl is like a needy girlfriend.  The more attention I give it, the more attention it demands.  If I don't pay attention to it, even for just a moment, perl finds a way to remind of its need for constant attention ...

Yes, perl and I have a love-hate relationship.

When I first met perl, I was taken in by its magic.  Perl was very generous with telling me its thoughts and feelings in text messages, using symbols like %, @, $, and &.  Perl would never get lost, because it always used a map, and never forgot anything at the store, because it always had a list.  Perl was a free spirit, not tied to its past -- it had closure with all its previous lovers.  And its willingness and pleasure to engage in delicious @_arguments ...

But after the romance faded, perl became more and more needy.  It took up all my attention with "features" like scalar vs. array contexts, massive number of global variables, painful and dangerous exception handling, implicit arguments to functions, magic variables such as $a, $b, $_, and, let's face it, the function "length" not working on arrays.

So what was the problem?  Was it just me or was it perl?  I'd like to think that I gave perl my all, and that it just wasn't good enough.  I never wanted to hurt perl's feelings.  But it hurt mine, and more besides.

Soon it seemed to my broken heart, perl was cavorting with others.  Running around in public, playing its amorous games.  All to emphasize to me that I wasn't good enough.  <i>Traitor.</i>  Perl wasn't 'strict' in its behavior toward others, it didn't give 'warnings' when people took liberties with it.  It wasn't possessive, giving 'my' presents away.  

And yet ... I keep coming back.

- excessive use of globals
- too many libraries for basic things
