<h1>Introduction</h1>
There are many kinds of joins in SQL.
This articles gives brief definitions of the major forms, along with their opposites if applicable, and how they can be applied.
For the rest of this article, we'll assume that we're using some kind of join to combine two tables, called the "left table"
and the "right table".  For instance, in the following code:
<pre class="code">
select * 
from lefttable
inner join righttable
on lefttable.id = righttable.id;
</pre>
`lefttable` is the left table, and `righttable` is the right table.  
These are the two tables being joined, and `lefttable.id = righttable.id` will be referred to as the "join predicate".
</p>


<p><h2>Inner vs. outer</h2>
Inner joins return only matching pairs of rows between the two tables.

Outer joins also return rows from one or both tables that <b>match 0 rows</b> from the other table.
<pre class="code">
</pre>
</p>


<p><h2>Outer join:  left and right outer join</h2>
Left outer joins return, in addition to the rows returned by the corresponding inner join, rows from the 
left table that don't match any rows in the right table.

Right outer joins are identical except that they also return unmatched rows from the right table.
<pre class="code">
select * 
from atoms 
left join (
  select * 
  from isotopes 
  where mass > 5
) q 
using (number);
</pre>
</p>


<p><h2>Semi vs. anti</h2>
"Semi"-joins return rows from the left table that match rows in the right table.

"Anti"-joins return rows from the left table that <b>don't</b> match rows in the right table.

Both of these join forms act as a sort of filter for the left table, since no columns from the right table are returned.
<pre class="code">
select distinct a.* from atoms a where number in (select mass from isotopes where mass > 3);

select distinct a.* from atoms a inner join isotopes i on a.number = i.mass and i.mass > 3;

select distinct a.* from atoms a where exists (select * from isotopes i where a.number = i.mass and i.mass > 3);
</pre>
</p>


<p><h2>Equi vs. theta</h2>
"Equi"-joins are those where the join predicate is an equality.

"Theta"-joins are those where the join predicate is an inequality.
<pre class="code">
select *
from atoms a
inner join
isotopes i
where a.number = i.mass; 

select *
from atoms a
inner join
isotopes i
where i.number > a.number; 
</pre>
</p>


<p><h2>Implicit vs. explicit</h2>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29#Inner_join">source</a>
Explicit joins use one of the "join" keywords, such as "inner join" or "left join", combined with a join predicate:
<pre class="code">
select * 
from table1 a
inner join table2 b
on a.id = b.fkid;
</pre>

While implicit joins do not use a "join" keyword, and place the join predicate in the "where" clause:
<pre class="code">
select *
from table1 a, table2 b
where a.id = b.fkid;
</pre>

Explicit joins are generally recommended, as they are thought to be 
more maintainable and more clearly express the programmer's intent.
</p>



<p><h2>Cross join</h2>
This produces a cartesian product of the tables, joining every row in the left table with every row in the right table.
<pre class="code">
select * from atoms a cross join isotopes i;

select * from atoms a inner join isotopes i on 1;
</pre>
</p>


<p><h2>Natural join</h2>
This join is not useful in practice, as it can be completely replaced by queries using (more easily understandable) inner joins.

The result is the set of rows, from the two tables, that have the <b>same values for columns of the same name.</b>

If the tables share all columns names, the result is an intersection.

If the tables share no column names, the result is a cartesian product.

The number of columns in the result is the number of distinct column names in the tables.
<pre class="code">
select * from atoms natural join isotopes;

select * from atoms inner join isotopes using (number);
</pre>
</p>


<p><h2>Self join</h2>
This is just a special case of a join where the same table is used for both sides of the join.

It can be combined with any of the preceding "join" forms.
<pre class="code">
</pre>
</p>
